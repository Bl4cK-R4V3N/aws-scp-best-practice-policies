## AWS SCP Best Practices

I was getting tired of finding multiple sources of good SCP policies that I can apply directly on an AWS Account on Day 1. This is a repository of AWS SCP which can be applied to AWS Accounts under an AWS Organization.

### Folder
AWS SCP Policies - Day 0 - This folder has SCP Policies that can be applied on the day you start using AWS Organizations
AWS SCP Policies - Post Day 0 - TBC

This is free for anyone to contribute into with security best practices. Feel free to send over a PR and I can work with you on adding policies.


Not all policies have been written by me. Some of the inspiration for these policies are from the following link
- [AWS SCP OFFICIAL Example](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scps_examples.html) 
- [Scott Piper's Blog](https://summitroute.com/blog/2020/03/25/aws_scp_best_practices/)
